CavQuest offers an engaging and interactive scavenger hunt experience, specifically designed for UVA students to explore their campus. The platform not only allows users to participate in various tasks but also lets them contribute by creating and adding their own challenges. Each user has a personalized profile to track their progress, and the website provides a tutorial to ensure a smooth user experience.
